Super simple JavaScript function for console logging, inspired by the Laravel dd() and dump() function.

## Install

You can install the package via npm or yarn:

```bash
$ npm install dd-js
$ yarn add dd-js
```

## Usage

```js
require('dd-js');

dump(foo); // This is just a plain console.log

dd(foo); // This will throw an exception after the logging to try to stop further execution
```
